# android-kotlin-notes-practice
Repo for my files on Kotlin and Android studio

There are practice projects uploaded. They uploaded here without their dependencies. Only the .kt files are uploaded for reference purposes.

Originally started learning XML UI method. Switched to Jetpack Compose. 

Declarative UI is much easier but I miss the constraint layouts in XML even if they were verbose.
